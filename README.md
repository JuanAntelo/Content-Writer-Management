# Content-Writer-Management

Inspired by all the research I've done into inbound marketing latley, this app keeps track of all the content writers for an organization. A content writer is someone who just writes content for a site, usually in the form of a blog post or a social media post but there is a section for 'other'. 

To view this application running go to: 

http://mighty-tundra-7996.herokuapp.com/ (may take few moments for the data come in)

This demonstrates basic RESTful AJAX calls and a pretty chart + table. Backend is in Python + Flask, no connection to db
