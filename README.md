# Content-Writer-Management

Inspired by all the research I've done into inbound marketing latley, this app keeps track of all the content writers for an organization. A content writer is someone who just writes content for a site, usually in the form of a blog post or a social media post but there is a section for 'other'. 

To view this application running go to:

This demonstrates basic RESTful AJAX calls and an a pretty chart + table
